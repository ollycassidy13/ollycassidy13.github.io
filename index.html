                    <h4>Studying</h4>
                    <p>I am a second-year Electronic and Information Engineering student, recently named to the Dean’s List for 2024 
                        ranking in the top 5% of the year, with a passion for building innovative hardware and software solutions. I 
                        recently undertook a research placement focused on ultra-low latency FPGA-based machine learning, 
                        first authoring a paper that explored hardware optimisation for real-time ML applications.
                        My academic journey, coupled with a strong work ethic and disciplined approach, drives everything I do.</p>

                    <p>I am also a dedicated athlete, running competitively for both Imperial College and Thames Valley Harriers. 
                        Training and competing as an athlete has taught me resilience, time management, and the importance of hard work, 
                        all of which I bring into my engineering work. I compete in 3k and 5k events on the track and whether I'm in the 
                        lab or on the track, I am committed to excellence, discipline, and continuous improvement.</p>

                        car and a landline from gate level to web design, cybersecurity, and software development. You can find more details

                        This creative outlet provides balance in my life, helping me maintain the resilience and discipline needed for 
                        my studies and running. By using Python automation to manage and expand these playlists, I can efficiently share 
                        my love for music while enriching my journey in both athletics and academics.</p>

                    <p>In this project I aimed to create a system to detect and classify network intrusions.
                        The project is based around a fully connected FNN which was trained on the CIC-IDS2017 dataset.
                        It is capable of detecting and distingushing between 15 different types of attack.
                        I implemented packet sniffing in C, before moving to use the scapy library in python to run the model.
